        I am a Staff Scientist with a background in cognitive psychology and human perception.

        My work involves building and evaluating research tools used in experimental settings, with an emphasis on practical use and reliable data.

        I care about how methodological and design decisions shape the day-to-day experience of researchers.

        I’m always happy to talk with others who are interested in applied research and research methods.
