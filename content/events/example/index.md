abstract: 'In this interview, VPixx Staff Scientist Dr. Sophie Kenny discusses the considerations and challenges of installing a PROPixx projection system in small spaces, including magnetically shielded rooms for OPM and MEG research systems. We discuss the advantages of using projection systems in these installations, where to put the projector, waveguides, concerns regarding participant position and eye height, and what kind of mirrors are best for projection installations.'
